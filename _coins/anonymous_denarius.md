Many of the coins featured so far have been denarii, but this is one of the first. The imagery exudes Roman self-confidence, with the obverse showing the personification of Rome as the goddess Roma. The reverse shows a mythical scene from Rome’s foundation where the gods Castor and Pollux (the Dioscuri) rode to the Republic’s aid in the Battle of Lake Regillus against the expelled Tarquins.

Its classic style would barely change for 100 years, and its high purity ensured that it was widely accepted. As circulation increased, the title ROMA faded away as it was apparent where the coin was from and who issued it. In the middle to late republican period, the denarius design would be used as a canvas for young nobles to exhibit the deeds of their family, and in the imperial period, to carry the face of the Emperor far and wide. The denarius remained in use through the Severan period but was slowly debased until only a wash of silver remained.

Such a famous coin and its imagery will lead to past and present imitations. The US “Mercury Dime,” issued 1916-45, is inspired by this design. The obverse showing winged Liberty is a close match to Roma. The reverse echoes the Roman symbolism showing the “fasces” carried by Roman magistrates lictors as a sign of their imperium- the power of command, along with an olive branch “symbolizing America’s military readiness and desire for peace.”

Attributing these anonymous denarii is often challenging. We must rely on small details such as the style of Roma’s earring, the number of tufts on the helmet, or the cape of the Dioscuri. The auction house listed as Crawford 139/1 with a date of 204 BC. However, this dating is incongruent with Crawford’s 189 - 180 BC dating. Another candidate is Cr. 53/2 from ~211 BC, but determining which one relies heavily on the size of ROMA on the reverse. As always with ancient objects, more research is needed. (Note: the work of @stevejbrinkman was helpful in attributing this coin).
