To the modern ears, Caligula conjures images of depravity, excess, and a bad 70s movie. To the Roman ears, it was the nickname of a beloved Imperial Prince “Little Boots”. Caligula grew up in the legionary bases on the frontiers in Germany. As a boy, he walked around camp in a soldier’s costume, his footwear (caligae) granting him his nickname.

On Tiberius’ death in March 37 AD, the Roman people were excited for this young “prince” to lead them, and for a while, Caligula appeared to do well. He stopped the prosecutions of Senators, burned Tiberius’ secret papers, and gave donatives to each citizen. However, Caligula fell ill in October and, upon recovering, began a series of excesses that are difficult to equal. The legions were marched to the sea, only then to be ordered to collect shells as victory spoils over Neptune. He commandeered ships to build a 3.5-mile bridge across the Bay at Baiae, then built a road overtop and raced chariots. His image was erected in temples across the Empire. In all, Caligula spent nearly all the 2,700,000,000 sestertii inheritance left by Tiberius in one year. This was at a time when a single legionary’s pay was 1000 sestertii per year.

Now broke, the despotism turned into high gear. Senators and Equites were quickly condemned, their property seized, and new taxes were introduced. Eventually, Caligula’s own bodyguards turned against him. Dead at 28 years old, some sources indicate the Senate attempted to reassert control, but Rome had moved on. Thankfully, the Empire had one remaining Caesar in the wings (Claudius), or at least, hiding behind the curtains.
