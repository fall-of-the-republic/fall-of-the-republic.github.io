Roman Republican coins carry a deep connection not only to the moment they were issued, but also to the past they referenced and the legacy of their moneyers.

This denarius was issued in 60* BCE by Lucius Cassius Longinus, brother of the more famous Caius, one of Caesar's assassins. The coin's imagery alludes to the Trial of the Vestal Virgins established via legislation in 114 BCE and was presided over by Lucius' ancestor. The obverse shows the goddess Vesta and the reverse depicts the Roman voting process. Citizens marked ballots with a V or P, signaling approval (V for VTI ROGAS, "as you say") or disapproval. Votes were cast into a cista (basket), but each tribe's vote was determined by internal majority. 

Unlike his brother, Lucius was a dedicated Caesarian. He served as proconsul in Thessaly under Caesar during the Civil War and later sided with Octavian against Antony. As tribune in 44 BCE, Lucius tried to block Antony's consolidation of power. Antony threatened Lucius with death if he approached the Senate and attempted to veto his actions. A response which was a deeply ironic considering Antony's eviction from the Senate in 49 BCE while tribune was Caesar's causa belli to initiate the Civil War. Lucius did not take part in the coming war with Brutus and his brother Caius and was later pardoned by Antony.

Most publications and references still date this coin to 63 BCE, following Crawford's original chronology. However, the Mesange Hoard, published by Hersh and Walker in 1984, argues for a revised date of 60 BCE. Few publications note this adjustment. This post adopts the convention and rationale from Liv Yarrow's "The Roman Republic to 49 BCE" of using a * to indicate a revised date
