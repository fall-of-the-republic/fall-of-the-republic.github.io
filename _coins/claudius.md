Claudius became Emperor in 41 AD after the murder of Caligula by the Praetorian Guard. He survived the rampage of that night by hiding behind a palace curtain. Upon discovery by the guards, he was taken to the Praetorian camp and hailed as Imperator, becoming the all-time Roman "hide and seek" champion. His promised donative to the guards of one-year pay played no role in their decision to elevate him.

Expectations for Claudius at the start of his reign were not high. His family often humiliated and shunned him for his bookish nature, physical deformities, and stammer. In his youth, he wrote a history of the Civil Wars that was "too accurate" and suppressed by Augustus. His rite of passage into manhood was conducted at night so no one might observe him. His uncle Tiberius granted him only the regalia of public office but never the office itself.

Despite no preparation or expectations of ruling, Claudius' reign was one of relative peace and stability. He expanded the empire by conquering Britannia—a feat that Caesar and Caligula (in his seashell campaign) could not accomplish.

While politically successful, Claudius was undone by his private life. His third wife, Messalina, was executed after numerous affairs and publicly marrying her lover. Her fourth wife, Agrippina the Younger, poisoned Claudius so that her son Nero might ascend to the throne rather than Claudius' younger natural son Britannicus. The tragedy continues as Nero eventually murdered both Britannicus and his mother.
