Commodus became sole emperor of the Roman Empire at 18 years of age upon the death of his father Marcus Aurelius in 180 AD. As a two millennium long parable about why teenagers should not be granted absolute power, his reign marks the "Fall" period of the Roman Empire. Possessing none of the wisdom nor fortitude of his father, he entrusted much of his rule to administrators and courtiers. Instead, he preferred to develop a cult of personality that equated him with the re-incarnation of the god Hercules and devoted significant time towards practicing his gladiatorial combat skills in the Colosseum. While gladiatorial games were much loved by the Roman people, the gladiators themselves were considered the lowliest in society, often being current or freed slaves. Thus, the behavior of the Emperor, who was both supreme military commander and chief priest among other high offices, was a significant affront to the Roman elite.

As Commodus' megalomania grew, statues and coinage were created showing him in the likeness of Hercules wearing a lion skin and carrying a club. His head was placed on the golden Colossus of Nero, and he even sought to rename the city of Rome after himself. Commodus was eventually assassinated on December 31st, 190 AD. A list of persons to be executed by Commodus was discovered, and those targeted turned on him. Poisoning was attempted first, but to no avail, and the conspirators sent Commodus' wrestling partner to strangle him.

The coin pictured shows Commodus early in his reign—a happier time for all.
