Known as the Philosopher Emperor for his Stoic treatise "Meditations", Marcus Aurelius spent much of his reign from 161 AD to 180 AD campaigning against Germanic tribes during the Marcomannic Wars from 166 AD until his death. A column commemorating his victory still stands in the Piazza Colonna along with a bronze equestrian statue in the Capitoline Museum in Rome.

His brilliance was noticed early in life by the Emperor Hadrian, who wished to name Marcus his successor, but was forced to select Antoninus Pius due to Marcus' young age. However, in accepting the Imperial position, Antoninus was required to adopt Marcus as his Caesar and eventual successor. Much of Marcus' life was spent in this heir apparent role and coins on Antoninus Pius frequently show the young, clean shaven, and curly haired Marcus. The coin here shows an older Marcus, more mature, and with a full philosopher's beard.

Marcus' death marks the end of the era of the "Five Good Emperors" as he was succeeded by his crazed son Commodus (effectively portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix in Gladiator). This decision is sometimes used as a "failing" of Marcus as he did not adopt a worthy successor like the preceding "Good Emperors". However, his predecessors did not have sons of their own and were not forced to make the choice that Marcus did. Failure to promote Commodus would have likely led to multiple centers of imperial power and eventual civil war. In the end, the choice was unavoidable. Despite calls that Marcus should have "taken care of" Commodus, the bonds of family are too powerful for even the Stoic master.

The accession of Commodus is often used to mark the beginning of the "Fall" of the Roman Empire as civil war, plague, and rapid monetary inflation quickly followed.
