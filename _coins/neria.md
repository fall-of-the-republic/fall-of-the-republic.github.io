This is the last denarius. Sort of. While the denomination was minted for another 200 years, this is the last Republican denarius minted in Rome. Ever. As Caesar crossed the Rubicon in early January 49 BCE, the Pompeian faction and the Senate prepared for war. Denarii were quickly minted celebrating Pompey as their leader, and this one, with a clear military tone on the reverse, to pay for the legions. But as Pompey's promised legions did not rise as he "stamped his feet", the Republican factions panicked and evacuated Rome for Brunidisium and then Greece.

This coin of full of symbolism during this turbulent time. On the reverse, a legionary eagle with hastatii and principes standards are prominent showing a clear preparation for war. In an unusual step, the names of that year's consuls are present. Likely this showed "legitimacy" of their Republican government, as compared to Caesar's illegal actions. However, David Sear notes the irony as these Consuls are the ones that rejected Caesar's peace terms, passed a *senatus consultum ultimum* against him, and literally forced a sword into Pompey's hand to demand he defend the Republic.

While we know how the story played out, the individuals involved could not. As Caesar marched against his government with only one legion, how confident was he of victory? As Pompey, the Consuls, and the Senate evacuated, they were sure they would return. The Republic had stood for hundreds of years and survived worse; how could the end be now? And the poor legionary caught in the middle, who likely had this coin pressed into his hand, how would it play out for him, his family, and his community? 

Eventually, the wars would end, peace would return, and denarii would be minted again. But these coins would not celebrate the ancestors of prominent senators or the Republican government, only Caesar's heirs- the Emperors.
