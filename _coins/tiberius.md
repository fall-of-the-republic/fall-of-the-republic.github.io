Tiberius became Augustus' stepson when his mother, Livia, was forced to divorce and marry Augustus. While never desired as an heir, Augustus was compelled to acknowledge Tiberius as his successor towards the end of his life. This "promotion" came with significant pain for Tiberius as he was required to leave his beloved wife for Augustus' daughter Julia. Even in death, Augustus did not embrace Tiberius as his final will began, "Since a cruel fate has bereft me of my sons Gaius and Lucius, be Tiberius Caesar heir to two-thirds of my estate."

A reluctant ruler, Tiberius attempted to govern through the Praetorian Prefect Sejanus in Rome while he withdrew from public life to Capri. In his absence, though, Sejanus conspired to overthrow Tiberius and engineered the murder of his son Drusus. In his rage and grief, Tiberius executed anyone associated with Sejanus and filled his later life with depravity and paranoia. Upon his death, Tiberius was not mourned, and the people of Rome shouted, "To the Tiber with Tiberius!" They did not yet know his successor would be not better in Caligula.

This denarius of Tiberius is called a "Tribute Penny" as they show the "likeness and titles of Caesar," as indicated in Matthew's text. The word "Penny" enters from the King James Bible, where it was substituted for denarius. Regarding this coin and whether to pay taxes, Jesus indicates, "Render unto Caesar what is Caesar's and unto God what is God's."

The coin reverse has religious implications as well. The inscriptions indicate PONTIFEX MAXIMUS or chief priest of the Roman Imperial religion. The office of Pontifex was held by Julius Caesar and then inherited by his successors. His modern-day "decedents" still exist as the Catholic Church adopted the title after the fall of the Western Empire. Today, we know them as the Popes.
