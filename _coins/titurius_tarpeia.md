After capturing new wives from the local tribes, the Romans braced for the inevitable response. Several groups attacked but were repelled until the assault of King Tatius and the Sabines. Retreating to the citadel on the Capitoline Hill, the Romans prepared for a siege. However, the gates were unexpectedly opened by Tarpeia, the daughter of the citadel commander, and the Romans fled to the Palatine Hill.

The following day, Romans and Sabines met in battle between the Capitoline and Palatine hills where the Forum now stands. As the combat raged, the abducted Sabine women threw themselves between their fathers on one side and their now husbands on the other, imploring them to end the conflict. Moved by their actions, Romulus and Tatius agreed to merge as one people and share the kingship over them.

Tarpeia's actions have long been disputed. Was she consumed by greed and exchanged "what the Sabines wore on their wrist" for access to the citadel? If so, instead of receiving gold bracelets, she was betrayed and crushed to death by the Sabines and the bronze shields on their arms. Were Tarpeia's actions a brave ploy to take the Sabine shields and make them defenseless against the Romans? Or, more likely, did the Romans lose the battle and needed some excuse for their actions? 

While no explanation is convincing, we do know what contemporary Romans believed. The area where the citadel was betrayed was a place of execution where murderers and traitors would be flung off the "Tarpeian Rock" as punishment for their crimes.
