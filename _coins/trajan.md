Optimus Princeps himself. Trajan was declared by the Senate the “Best Emperor” for his military conquests that expanded the Roman Empire to its largest extent. At the time of Trajan’s death in 117 AD, the Empire covered two million square miles that ran from modern-day Scotland in the North, to the headwaters of the Nile in the South, as far West as the Atlantic Ocean and as far East as the Persian Gulf.

Trajan was the first “Provincial” Emperor, born outside of mainland Italy in Hispania. As military service was the only way for non-Italians to elevate their station, he began a military career at a young age. His success in the legions was the primary reason for his adoption by Emperor Nerva, who was from the Senatorial class and was not popular with the legions. His adoption of the standout general staved off a probable revolt from the army.

Upon his ascension in 98 AD, Trajan began a military and building campaign whose remnants are still visible today, including the Alcantara Bridge in Spain and pillars from the first permanent bridge across the Rhine. Most visited though is the expanded Forum in Rome and his column to commemorate his victory in Dacia.

Although the Romans did not know it, this was their Optimo “Best” time and the Empire’s largest extent and power. Hints of trouble that would plague the later Empire began to appear as Trajan initiated a slight debasement in silver coinage. Despite vast military conquests, his successor Hadrian would rapidly abandon the territorial gains in the East. However, future challenges were not yet known, and Trajan set the standard to which all future emperors would be compared. Each one at their investiture receiving the prayer “May he be luckier than Augustus and better than Trajan.”
